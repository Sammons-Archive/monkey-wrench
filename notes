-Things I am working on in monkey-wrench
	are for general use purposes, typically things I want
	to do, and have decided I want to do in a reusable fashion
	(sometimes I am just not in the mood to attack a full project either)

-TODO
	*	change that freaking express favicon
	
	*	write scanner script which will look at views folder and generate a
		view-routes.js file which will be passed to app.use()	

	*	create a generic method to implement openid for google
		https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OpenID

	*	create a generic method to implement oauth 2.0 for google
		-this can be accomplished using strictly frontend code
		also https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login

	* 	create or find a module that will make database calls generic (SQL concealed? or nosql)

	*	create or find a method of deploying both a --bare git repo and a production git repo
		in a single one off command
